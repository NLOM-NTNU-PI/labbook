## ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-V-I

Initial testing of experiments to check if we can use old cell cultures as reference points and setting power adjustments appropriately.

Used samples from 070922 that had nearly dried out before new PBS was added. No SHG signal was seen so these samples can not be used as a reference.

Maybe we can in the future use a well plate with a slide that can be separated and thus mount properly.

Testing first with cartilage sample. Very little signal in reflected channel 50/30 power.
(Should maybe make some new cartilage reference samples)

* 001 Cartilage sample near bone interface
* 002 Cartilage sample, cartilage proper

Changed to reference sample (?) created previously

* 003 Cells visible with high power (50/50). No apparent collagen production

Well plate from incubator - very few cells. Well plate number 2.
IBIDI marker bottom left.
Bottom left well
Region A1

* 004 Quite high from bottom. Cells maybe not attached, floating?
* 005 Closer to surface
