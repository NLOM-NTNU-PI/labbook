## ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-V-I

Initial testing of experiments to check if we can use old cell cultures as reference points and setting power adjustments appropriately.

Used samples from 070922 that had nearly dried out before new PBS was added. No SHG signal was seen so these samples can not be used as a reference.

Maybe we can in the future use a well plate with a slide that can be separated and thus mount properly.
