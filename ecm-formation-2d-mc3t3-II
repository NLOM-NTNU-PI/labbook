Experiment: ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-II

# ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-II-1
Date: 08032022
Instrument: Leica SP8 MP
Sample: ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-II. MC3T3 cells. Seeded yesterday, new media today with ascorbic acid and phosphate to trigger growth of ECM.
Data: ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-II-1.lif

## Start up
* start microscope according to standard procedure, initalize stage
* Connect CO2, starte temperature controled
* Clean and mount incubation chamber
* Mount water pump.
* Old sample for Kohler and settings (ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3, slide M1, well (1,2) (ibdi mark upper left))

Test of old image. Signal good. Power, Gain = 50,50. TLD gain 800. Strong signal at these settings. 
50,50 power seemed to give visible photo damage. Maybe due to stains.
Tried 4x4 frame with 8 stacks 100 Hz and 1024x1024 - takes too long, about 10 min
4x4 frame with 200, 2 stacks continous time intervals looks promising.

Slide M1, well (1,2) (black mark lower left), Area A1
Scan 4 frames, 200 hz, one stack, continous intervals
Temperature is 32 degrees.

# ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-II-2

Startup. Remember to set GDD. Much stronger signal.
Reference image taken from ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3, slide M1, well (1,1).
Placed slide M1 from current experiment, well (1,2) (black mark lower left, ibid upper right)
Difficult to get water started. Try high voltage and frequency first to get it going.


Collagen clearly present (remember gdd was not set yesterday)

Starte scan with power (50,30 - same as reference). Area A1-B2. Every 30 min.

Water dried out at frame 14.

Changed water interval to 9s/1min (instead of 9s/4min)

Moved to area C1. Time series on single area
Also this area dried out after about an hour.

* experiment: ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-II
* date: 10032022
* instrument: leica sp8 mp

## Start up
Started system according to procedure
Water pump set to 17s every 1 min.

## Measurements
Orientation of slides, IBIDI marke upper right.
Reference sample ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3, well (1,2)
Reuse settings from ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-II-2
Slide M1 mounted, well (1,3). Temperature at 30 deg.

Series 003 - water immersion dried out after about 2h 20 min.
Added new water immersion.
Changed water pump to 30 s every 1 min.
Temperature at 35 deg, reduced airflow to about 50 %
Moved to area B1.

# ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-II-4

* experiment: ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-II
* date: 11032022
* instrument: leica sp8 mp

## Start up
Started system according to procedure
Water pump set to 12 s/2 min at 85 Vpp (started at every 4 min but saw little change in container)

## Measurements
Orientation of slides, IBIDI marke upper right.
Reference sample ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3, well (2,2)
Stored as Image001

Keep same settings
Slide M1 mounted, well (2,3).  Area A1.
Image002 - reference image
Series003 - Time series (after about 30 min changed from water pump every 4 min to water pump every 2 min - saw no change in water container).
