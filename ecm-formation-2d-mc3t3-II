Experiment: ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-II

# ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-II-1
Date: 08032022
Instrument: Leica SP8 MP
Sample: ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-II. MC3T3 cells. Seeded yesterday, new media today with ascorbic acid and phosphate to trigger growth of ECM.
Data: ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-II-1.lif

## Start up
* start microscope according to standard procedure, initalize stage
* Connect CO2, starte temperature controled
* Clean and mount incubation chamber
* Mount water pump.
* Old sample for Kohler and settings (ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3, slide M1, well (1,2) (ibdi mark upper left))

Test of old image. Signal good. Power, Gain = 50,50. TLD gain 800. Strong signal at these settings. 
50,50 power seemed to give visible photo damage. Maybe due to stains.
Tried 4x4 frame with 8 stacks 100 Hz and 1024x1024 - takes too long, about 10 min
4x4 frame with 200, 2 stacks continous time intervals looks promising.

Slide M1, well (1,2) (black mark lower left), Area A1
Scan 4 frames, 200 hz, one stack, continous intervals
Temperature is 32 degrees.

# ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-II-2

Startup. Remember to set GDD. Much stronger signal.
Reference image taken from ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3, slide M1, well (1,1).
Placed slide M1 from current experiment, well (1,2) (black mark lower left, ibid upper right)
Difficult to get water started. Try high voltage and frequency first to get it going.


Collagen clearly present (remember gdd was not set yesterday)

Starte scan with power (50,30 - same as reference). Area A1-B2. Every 30 min.

Water dried out at frame 14.

Changed water interval to 9s/1min (instead of 9s/4min)

Moved to area C1. Time series on single area
Also this area dried out after about an hour.
