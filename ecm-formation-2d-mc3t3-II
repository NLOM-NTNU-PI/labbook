## Start up
* start microscope according to standard procedure, initalize stage
* Connect CO2, starte temperature controled
* Clean and mount incubation chamber
* Mount water pump.
* Old sample for Kohler and settings (ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3, slide M1, well (1,2) (ibdi mark upper left))

Test of old image. Signal good. Power, Gain = 50,50. TLD gain 800. Strong signal at these settings. 
50,50 power seemed to give visible photo damage. Maybe due to stains.
Tried 4x4 frame with 8 stacks 100 Hz and 1024x1024 - takes too long, about 10 min
4x4 frame with 200, 2 stacks continous time intervals looks promising.

Slide M1, well (1,2) (black mark lower left), Area A1
Scan 4 frames, 200 hz, one stack, continous intervals
Temperature is 32 degrees.
