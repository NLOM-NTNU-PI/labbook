The aim of this experiment is to test fixed samples of MC3T3 cells in culture for use as a reference.

...were used

Signal is very weak at 50/30 - 400

* Image001 - at 8-bit.
Switch to 16 bit.
Power 50/30
* Image002 - 100 Hz.
* Image003 - 50 Hz.
* Image004 - 25 Hz.
* Image005 - 10 Hz.
Swtich back to 100 Hz
* Image006 - 100 Hz
Change Line Accumulate.
* Image007 - Line accumulate 2
Deleted #8 - used start instead of capture.
* Image009 - line accumulation 4
Test power, linn acc = 1
* Image010 - 50/30
* Image011 - 50/40
* Image012 - 50/50
* Image013 - 50/60
* Image014 - 50/70
Forgot to put gain on TLD - set to 800 now. (15 stopped, deleted)
* Image016 - Line acc 2
Change zoon to 0.95
* Image017 - Line acc 4
Refocus. Much easier when you can actually see a signal (at 600 Hz).
* Image018 At 100 Hz
(Maybe some changes in structure? Small specks?)
* Image019 Same again
* Image020 1024, 100 Hz. 50/70 (good for productions?)
