Testing microscope settings.

Brightfield DIC. Adjust kohler, focus, change to DIC, adjust DIC setting

ECM-morphogensis.21.1

BF-1 
Transmission image max zoom out (25x)
BF-2
Transmission image. zoom 0.9 Can just see border
BF-3
DIC image at zoom 1.5. Min zoom seems to be 1.28 controlled by software. Dark edge on image. 
BF-4
Zoom 2.5. Reduced border. Laser alignment?
BF-5
Adjusted DIC prism bias (lower left in software). DIC effect much clearer.

Adjustments in Fluo-Turret: DIC-pol (polarisation effects?) also an option
MP-1
Multiphoton of cell. Good autofluorescence. Probably as good as DIC for imaging
MP-2
Zoom out full, probably quite easy to segment fairly well

Switch to stage top incubator
BF-6 
Bright field image with stage top incubator
BF-7
DIC image
MP-3
MP image - (remember to switch on MP in laser control)

Switched to 63x water objective. Seems like there was no need to add water.

Weak fluorescence signal -remember pinhole for internal detectors.

# ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-1

Inital imaging of MC3T3 samples

* Start MP system according to start up procedure
* Start the software - no water pump, activate AFC, initalize stage
* Start water controller before software. Place cap on objective (from underneath stage)
** After water has emerged on top, set to interval timer
* Place incubation chamber. Clean chamber surfaces with ethanol. Clean surfaces in contact with well-plate
* Once system has thermalized, start C02 flow

After system has stablized.
* Put on gloves, steralize
* Take dish with well-plates to flow-hood.
* Move one well-plate to sterile dish with cloth in bottom
* Move new dish to microscope.
* Place well plate in incubator

Start with well-plate M1

Incubator temperature at 37 degrees when moving temperature sensor to middle of chamber

Cells look ok (triangular) and dense i BF. DIC not much improvement (forgot to adjust kohler though...)

~~Well 7 field A2~~
(addition) I believe the above is incorrect. Confused due to inversion of grid in image. The well number is 2 (II in experiment plan) and field is A1 (there were some engraving errors)

Had to restart software as MP laser was not enabled.

# ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-2

## Plan
* Start with well plate C1
* Image the wells with different seeding denities (S1-S3). 9 fields at different locations. Use 25x.
* Image the wells with different culturing media (nP1, nP2). 9 fields at different locations. Use 25x.
* Change well-plate to M1
* Reimage the images from yesterday the previous measurement (Well-plate M1, well 2, field A1)
* The axial resolution of the 25x is very low. Check if we can get good signal with the 63x objectives. 
* Take a series of multiple frames, different wells, well-plates for serial imaging and testing matrix screener *must read*. Also to test the amount of time it takes.
* Take a new high t-resolution series. Put in water-pump only for this experiment.

(Remember Kohler before DIC)

## Info
* 20.12.2021
* Cell cultures as described in ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3
* Leica SP8 system in D4-151, NTNU

## Experiment
First experiment is for testing effect of different seeding densities

Well-plate C1, well S2 (50e5 cells), 
* 001 field A1 (lower left when seen from above well-plate), z-stack, 5 mu interval. Only SGG
* 002 A2
* 003 A3
* 004 deleted. wrong settings
* 005 B3. Turned on TPEF (RLD1)
* 006 B3 again, with FSHG (TLD2)
* 007 B2 

Skipped B1 due to particulate giving detector saturation

* 008 C1
* 009 C2
* 010 deleted due to wrong settings
* 011 C3

Switch to well S1 (10e5)

* 012 A1
* 013 A2
* 014 A3
* 015 B3
* 016 B2
* 017 B1
* 018 C1

C2 and C3 skipped due to large particulate saturating detector and loss of waterdrop

Switched to well s3 (normal seeding density)

* 019 deleted due to detector saturation
* 020 A1
* 021 A2
* 022 A3

Skipped B1 due to saturation of detector

* 024 B2
* 025 B3

Skipped C1 due to saturation

* 026 C2
* 026 C3

Switched to well-plate with different culturing media. nP1 and nP2 were on the right side when the Ibidi logo was topp right, upside down. Writing in occular was then right side up with A to the left and 1 on top
Start with bottom rigth, ~~no -P, +AA~~ (addition) -P & -AA

A1 saturated

* 027 B1
* 028 C1
* 029 D1
* 030 E1

Switched to well with ~~-P, -AA~~ (addition) -P

* 031 A1
* 031 B1

Switched to reference well to left of previous when seen from condensor.

* 033 A1
* 034 B1

Switched to well-plate M1

Well II
* 035 A1 Repeat from previous experiment. Placed approximately in middle where signal was strongest. z-stack
* 036 A1 Repeat without z-stack
* 037 B1 middle
* 038 B1 deeper (further from glass). Notice increased ordering.
* 039 C1. Middle. The FSHG is very strong compared to last time. Maybe missed due to Kohler and some optimizing. Should investigate if this is a true signal change.
* 040 B2 z-stack 1 mu intervals

Change to 63x objective.

* 041 B2 z-stack 1mu 
* 042 B3 Attempt at nice 63x image
* 043 D3 t-scan 1 min intervall 30 min

# ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-3

## Aim
The aim of this experiment is to test Leica matrix screener scripting software for automated imaging of many fields and wells.

## Experiment
Well-plate M2 was used.

Placed the Ibidi logo upper right (seen from above), inverted. Inscriptions are then upright in occular

Started imaging on well upper left (well PT2 in original plan). 

Remember AFC cannot be used with water pump.

Remember waterdrop if low signal

Rotating scanfield gives significanly lower signal.

Maybe use a different insert to avoid edges interfering with water drop (larger opening)

OFfset in matrix screener is set to 100 which is wrong - should be around 60

Slide must be as aligned to stage as possible

Did not get to the point where all settings were completed in matrix screener. Need to redo experiment. Perhaps only using well

During shut down, noticed that the gas had not been turned on. Might have affected the cells.

Also try without the insert in the stage to avoid drop problems

## Aims

* Assess viability of imaged and unimaged cells using viability kit
*

## Plan

* Image fields with
** long term exposure
** nearby unimaged field
** field that has not been taken out of incubator
** fields with different seeding densities
** Fields with different culturing media.
* Fix cells after incubation.
* (If time additional imaging of previously imaged and unimaged areas)
