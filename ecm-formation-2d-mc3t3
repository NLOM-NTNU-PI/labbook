# ecm-morphogensis-21-1
Testing microscope settings.

Brightfield DIC. Adjust kohler, focus, change to DIC, adjust DIC setting

ECM-morphogensis.21.1

BF-1 
Transmission image max zoom out (25x)
BF-2
Transmission image. zoom 0.9 Can just see border
BF-3
DIC image at zoom 1.5. Min zoom seems to be 1.28 controlled by software. Dark edge on image. 
BF-4
Zoom 2.5. Reduced border. Laser alignment?
BF-5
Adjusted DIC prism bias (lower left in software). DIC effect much clearer.

Adjustments in Fluo-Turret: DIC-pol (polarisation effects?) also an option
MP-1
Multiphoton of cell. Good autofluorescence. Probably as good as DIC for imaging
MP-2
Zoom out full, probably quite easy to segment fairly well

Switch to stage top incubator
BF-6 
Bright field image with stage top incubator
BF-7
DIC image
MP-3
MP image - (remember to switch on MP in laser control)

Switched to 63x water objective. Seems like there was no need to add water.

Weak fluorescence signal -remember pinhole for internal detectors.

# ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-1

Inital imaging of MC3T3 samples

* Start MP system according to start up procedure
* Start the software - no water pump, activate AFC, initalize stage
* Start water controller before software. Place cap on objective (from underneath stage)
** After water has emerged on top, set to interval timer
* Place incubation chamber. Clean chamber surfaces with ethanol. Clean surfaces in contact with well-plate
* Once system has thermalized, start C02 flow

After system has stablized.
* Put on gloves, steralize
* Take dish with well-plates to flow-hood.
* Move one well-plate to sterile dish with cloth in bottom
* Move new dish to microscope.
* Place well plate in incubator

Start with well-plate M1

Incubator temperature at 37 degrees when moving temperature sensor to middle of chamber

Cells look ok (triangular) and dense i BF. DIC not much improvement (forgot to adjust kohler though...)

~~Well 7 field A2~~
(addition) I believe the above is incorrect. Confused due to inversion of grid in image. The well number is 2 (II in experiment plan) and field is A1 (there were some engraving errors)

m1-001:
BF image

m1-001
BF-DIC

Had to restart software as MP laser was not enabled.

(addition) Project saved and new project started named ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-1b

# ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-2

## Plan
* Start with well plate C1
* Image the wells with different seeding denities (S1-S3). 9 fields at different locations. Use 25x.
* Image the wells with different culturing media (nP1, nP2). 9 fields at different locations. Use 25x.
* Change well-plate to M1
* Reimage the images from yesterday the previous measurement (Well-plate M1, well 2, field A1)
* The axial resolution of the 25x is very low. Check if we can get good signal with the 63x objectives. 
* Take a series of multiple frames, different wells, well-plates for serial imaging and testing matrix screener *must read*. Also to test the amount of time it takes.
* Take a new high t-resolution series. Put in water-pump only for this experiment.

(Remember Kohler before DIC)
