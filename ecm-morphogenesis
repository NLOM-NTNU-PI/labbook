# ecm-morphogensis-21-1
Testing microscope settings.

Brightfield DIC. Adjust kohler, focus, change to DIC, adjust DIC setting

ECM-morphogensis.21.1

BF-1 
Transmission image max zoom out (25x)
BF-2
Transmission image. zoom 0.9 Can just see border
BF-3
DIC image at zoom 1.5. Min zoom seems to be 1.28 controlled by software. Dark edge on image. 
BF-4
Zoom 2.5. Reduced border. Laser alignment?
BF-5
Adjusted DIC prism bias (lower left in software). DIC effect much clearer.

Adjustments in Fluo-Turret: DIC-pol (polarisation effects?) also an option
MP-1
Multiphoton of cell. Good autofluorescence. Probably as good as DIC for imaging
MP-2
Zoom out full, probably quite easy to segment fairly well

Switch to stage top incubator
BF-6 
Bright field image with stage top incubator
BF-7
DIC image
MP-3
MP image - (remember to switch on MP in laser control)

Switched to 63x water objective. Seems like there was no need to add water.

Weak fluorescence signal -remember pinhole for internal detectors.

# ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-1

Inital imaging of MC3T3 samples

* Start MP system according to start up procedure
* Start the software - no water pump, activate AFC, initalize stage
* Start water controller before software. Place cap on objective (from underneath stage)
** After water has emerged on top, set to interval timer
* Place incubation chamber. Clean chamber surfaces with ethanol. Clean surfaces in contact with well-plate
* Once system has thermalized, start C02 flow

After system has stablized.
* Put on gloves, steralize
* Take dish with well-plates to flow-hood.
* Move one well-plate to sterile dish with cloth in bottom
* Move new dish to microscope.
* Place well plate in incubator

Start with well-plate M1
