Sample:
test-sample:213LFC-3AX

instrument: Leica-SP8-MP

## Start up

Microscope did not turn with main switch - was turned of off on controller box.
T-stage was set to 29 deg. Changed to 37 deg.

* Mounted test sample (porcine cartilage)
* Adjusted Kohler
* Placed cells on microscope at 1311. 31 degrees.
* Wellplate with IBIDI mark lower left. This makes grid markers upside down in occular.
* Place objective at A1 location, well 1,1.
* Seems to be significant photobleaching while locating sample at 50/40
* Place at area C2. Power 50/30.
* Started time series at 1323. 5 min intervals.
* Changed water at 1505 (stopped to series002). Still plenty of water left so rather than changing water at a specific time a better strategy could be to visually check if there is water left and only change if necessary. Seemed like the previous area was found quite well.
* Tried to use mobile phone to check water around 1640 but HyD saturated immediately. Better to stop and start imaging. Stopped (to series003) and restarted at 1643. Seemed to be plenty of water. T = 35.7 (doors of big incubator were open).
* 1736 (stopped to series004) Added water. T = 36.1.
* 1932 Checked water drop (Stopped to series005), seemed to be plenty of water left. Restarted. 
* 2128 Checked water (stopped to series006). Seemed to be still quite a bit left.
* about 2320. Signal drifted, seemed like focus was drifting away. Large blob in likely same location. Signal seems somewhat worse. Captured and image in what is likely same location. Image008.
* Moved to area D2. Some collagen is appearing here.
* 0549. Still partly in focus but some drift during the night. C02 flask empty during the night.
* Image010 Single Image at D2, refocused. Some collagen network present. About 5 mu into sample from previous series.
* Moved to D3. Changed power to 50/50 - made a huge difference in signal. Image 011
* Took same image at 50/30 as a reference. Image012.
* Image013 at D5, 50/50. Was at 400 Hz
* Image 014 - same at 100 Hz.
* G5. Image015. The slide seems very slanted which is probably what gives it the banded effect. 

# ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-IV-2

Image cells that have been stained with cell viability kit.
Cells have been incubated with stains for 30 min at 1310.

* image001 - error, capture single image instead of all channels
* series002 - area C2 - quite a bit of dead cells. zoom = 1.
* image003 - set zoom to 0.85
* series004 - area C2 at zoom 0.85
* series005 - arae
* series006 - area B2
* series007 - area C2
* series008 - area C3
* series009 - area C5

The coverslip had cracked. This might be the cause of the large tilting in the images. Also perhaps the sudden out of focus.

Move to well 2,1 area A10

* series010 - much flatter field of view. maybe further from cracks. But also here quite a bit of dead cells. 
* series011. Area A09

Slide discarded after imaging.

## Cell culture fixation

Slide S2 fixed according to protocol protocoll-cell-culture-fixation.md (~/protocols)

## ecm-formation-2d-mc3t3-IV-3

sample: mc3t3-IV-S2

Collect large amount of images for staining

Wellplate was placed with IBIDI marke lower left. Wells with cells were then to the left. well A1 is then on bottom right. Assume bottom right well is well 1,1.

Start at well 1,1 area A1.

* Cells are not very fluorescent. Enhancing intensity makes them visible
* Series001 with zoom 1.2
* Series002 with zoom 0.8. Significant photobleaching is visible.
* series003-005. Testing out z-settings.

changed to 16 bit. The cell and collagen layer is very thin. Collect two layers 3 mu appart just to test z-collection procedure

For z-settings: choose 2 steps (or desired). Find start position by imaging. Set begin at current position. Add desired stack size to start position and enter into end position.

1024x1024, 50/50 power, line average 2. 

* series006 start at A1

Fluorescence saturates very quickly.

* series007 wrong settings
* series008 A2
* sereis009 wrong settings
* series010 A3

Try sequential scan. SHG at 50/50, TPEF at 50/30

* series011 A4
* series012 A5

estimate about 4 min per image, including chaning

* series013 A6 - Hyd shut down
* series014 A7
* series015 A8 - The images have become much more diffuse??

Sequentil scanning seems too complicated, try just shg signal

* Image016 A1
* Image017 A2
* Image018 A3
* Image019 A4
* Image020 A5 - wrong settings
* Image021 A5
* Image022 A6
* Image023 A7
* Image024 A8
* Image025 A9
* Location A10 - saturates, confirmed end of array
* Image026 B10
* Image027 B9
* Image028 B8
* Image029 B7
* Location B6 - saturates
* Image030 B5
* Image031 B4
* Image032 B3
* Image033 B2
* Image034 B1, confirmed end of array
* Image035 C1
* Image036 C2
* Image037 C3
* Image038 C4
* Image039 C5
* Image040 C6
* Image041 C7
* Image042 C8
* Image043 C9
* Image044 C10, Confirmed end of line.

Change to well 2,1 (using bottom right as (1,1) and left of that as (2,1).) This well should have a different medium.

* Image045 A1
* Image046 A2
* Image047 A3
* Image048 A4, debris
* Image049 A5, debris
* Image050 A6
* Image051 A7
* Image052 A8
* Image053 A9
* Image054 A10, confirmed end of array
* Image055 B10
* Image056 B9
* Image057 B8
* Image058 B7
* Image059 B6
* Image060 B5
* Image061 B4
* Image062 B3
* Image063 B2
* Image064 B1 some debris, not end of array, missing one. This was B2. I think that B2 was repeated at two different depths. B1 not included due to large debris.

* Image065 C1
* Image066 C2, large debris
* Image067 C3
* Image068 C4, debris
* Image069 C5
* Image070 C6, saturated
* Image071 C7
* Image072 C8
* Image073 C9
* Image074 C10, confirmed end of array.


There is some variation in z so when adjusting for max intensity this might affect the chosen layer and thus structure.
