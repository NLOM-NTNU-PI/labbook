Sample:
test-sample:213LFC-3AX

instrument: Leica-SP8-MP

## Start up

Microscope did not turn with main switch - was turned of off on controller box.
T-stage was set to 29 deg. Changed to 37 deg.

* Mounted test sample (porcine cartilage)
* Adjusted Kohler
* Placed cells on microscope at 1311. 31 degrees.
* Wellplate with IBIDI mark lower left. This makes grid markers upside down in occular.
* Place objective at A1 location, well 1,1.
* Seems to be significant photobleaching while locating sample at 50/40
* Place at area C2. Power 50/30.
* Started time series at 1323. 5 min intervals.
* Changed water at 1505 (stopped to series002). Still plenty of water left so rather than changing water at a specific time a better strategy could be to visually check if there is water left and only change if necessary. Seemed like the previous area was found quite well.
* Tried to use mobile phone to check water around 1640 but HyD saturated immediately. Better to stop and start imaging. Stopped (to series003) and restarted at 1643. Seemed to be plenty of water. T = 35.7 (doors of big incubator were open).
* 1736 (stopped to series004) Added water. T = 36.1.
* 1932 Checked water drop (Stopped to series005), seemed to be plenty of water left. Restarted. 
* 2128 Checked water (stopped to series006). Seemed to be still quite a bit left.
* about 2320. Signal drifted, seemed like focus was drifting away. Large blob in likely same location. Signal seems somewhat worse. Captured and image in what is likely same location. Image008.
* Moved to area D2. Some collagen is appearing here.
* 0549. Still partly in focus but some drift during the night. C02 flask empty during the night.
* Image010 Single Image at D2, refocused. Some collagen network present. About 5 mu into sample from previous series.
* Moved to D3. Changed power to 50/50 - made a huge difference in signal. Image 011
* Took same image at 50/30 as a reference. Image012.
* Image013 at D5, 50/50. Was at 400 Hz
* Image 014 - same at 100 Hz.
* G5. Image015. The slide seems very slanted which is probably what gives it the banded effect.

Image cells that have been stained with cell viability kit.
Cells have been incubated with stains for 30 min at 1310.

* image001 - error, capture single image instead of all channels
* series002 - area C2 - quite a bit of dead cells. zoom = 1.
* image003 - set zoom to 0.85
* series004 - area C2 at zoom 0.85
* series005 - arae
* series006 - area B2
* series007 - area C2
* series008 - area C3
* series009 - area C5

The coverslip had cracked. This might be the cause of the large tilting in the images. Also perhaps the sudden out of focus.

Move to well 2,1 area A10

* series010 - much flatter field of view. maybe further from cracks. But also here quite a bit of dead cells. 
* series011. Area A09

Slide discarded after imaging.
