Series00*
1 - First image of cells. Looks stained but z-resolution might not be sufficient for anything useful.
2 - Tried z-stack, something wrong with limits
3 - z-stack through sample
4 - Including SHG. Power 30/35 almost saturates cellular fluorescence
5 - sequentila scan with two different powers.
6 - time series. some indication that the cells are not too happy
7 - saturated.
8,9 - deleted
10 - Same location, single image. One area is dark.
11 - samme settings but area to the side
start single scan (not sequential) every 2 minutes.
12 - time series
Switched to 63x 1.4 oil
13 -single
14 - sequential, TPEF on internal
15 deleted
16 sequential, both NDD
There is a diffuse SHG signal. Could this perhaps be thin collagen that does not appear as clear fibrils
17 - z- stack.

To try 40x
