Series00*
1 - First image of cells. Looks stained but z-resolution might not be sufficient for anything useful.
2 - Tried z-stack, something wrong with limits
3 - z-stack through sample
4 - Including SHG. Power 30/35 almost saturates cellular fluorescence
5 - sequentila scan with two different powers.
6 - time series. some indication that the cells are not too happy
7 - saturated.
8,9 - deleted
10 - Same location, single image. One area is dark.
11 - samme settings but area to the side
start single scan (not sequential) every 2 minutes.
12 - time series
Switched to 63x 1.4 oil
13 -single
14 - sequential, TPEF on internal
15 deleted
16 sequential, both NDD
There is a diffuse SHG signal. Could this perhaps be thin collagen that does not appear as clear fibrils
17 - z- stack.

To try 40x

Uncertain about which slide was imaged in the previous run. 

Sample: stained cells (probably the one I didn't use last time.
Series00
1 - random well. Strong SHG signal, well developed ECM
2 - wrong settings
3 - another random well.

Switched to slide with no stain. Image was somewhat unclear in the occulars. Do not know why. Took of sample, wiped off immersion and under slide. Problem solved. Very clear now.

4 - random well, structure looks quite similar.
5 - new random slide.

Switched to other stained sample. Think it was the one I used last experiment
Tried to locate well imaged last time but uncertain. No clear diseased cells.
6 - random well
7 - Adjacent well. No apparent differences
8 - another random well
9 - at 2x zoom. Seems like the stain is accumulating in vesciles, unless this is overlap of autolfluorescence
