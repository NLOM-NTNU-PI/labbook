Series00*
1 - First image of cells. Looks stained but z-resolution might not be sufficient for anything useful.
2 - Tried z-stack, something wrong with limits
3 - z-stack through sample
4 - Including SHG. Power 30/35 almost saturates cellular fluorescence
5 - sequentila scan with two different powers.
