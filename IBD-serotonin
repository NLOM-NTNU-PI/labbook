# IBD-serotnoin/21/1

The goal of this experiment is a preliminary exploration of the samples as a basis for design of future studies. In particular to test if the samples yield an interesting an measureable SHG signal.

##Experiment

(RLD2/TLD2 is shorter wavelength, ie SHG)

Using Leica SP8 standard MP configuration. Error message 51 from cameleon laser during init.

Test image of cartilage gave good signal

In BF of MI three layers could be seen. An inner layer with radial directionality, a middle layer with circumferential directionality, an outer layer with radial directionality. Relativ thickness about 1/1/3.

Image 10653-26t
Middle layer seems to give a good SHG signal both forward and backwards. The thickness of the layer seems to vary in thickness. First images were off focus. In focus a top layer with stronger fluorescene appears and holes (canals) in the lower layer appears. THere seems to be some SHG signal (collagen fibrils?) on the innermost surface.

At zoom 1, 100Hz, power 23/42 no sign of damage.

Can see vessels in the collagen rich layer.

There is some collagen in the outer surface, that also extends down in the first layer. The signal in the inner layer is weak. Saturation of some necessary to see.

At another location, no SHG can be seen in the inner surface. But the surface looks a little different, maybe a sectioning artifact.

Seems like no DAPI signal (tried at 780 excitation).

The samples are quite thin, no z-stack possible. But the optimal imaging plane zeems quite flat. OK for tilescabn

Difficult with tile scan as the fluorescence hyd overloads and goes blank.

Setting up til xcan worked well

Tried to change flourescence to internal signal bu very little signal there. But fully opening pin hole again gave a good signal.

Change sample to 10054-

##Notes
Checked SHG signal on cartilage test sample - good signal. Also good fluorescence in internal PMT.

Sample 10653-23t

001 Image of DAPI. Good signal laser: 30/25, gain pmt 750, bw 395-450
002 Same location - multichannel
004 New location
005 Zoom = 2 Some SHG extending into the lamina propria
006 zoom 2, outside the mucosa muscularis, 
007 Zoom 4 (according to system z stack is 15 mu - not much resolution to hope for - try 63 x)
009 Different location
010 Differen location
011 Zoom just abov mucosa muscularis

10654-27t
012 Seems to be some change in the submucosa? Much broader and less dens in some regions, 
013 same, different location
014 Transition between 'normal/thin' region and thicker
On preivous 3 images forgot to put on 50 Hz
015 'Normal region'
016 Transition region again at 50 hz
017 Thick region again at 50 hz
018 'kjertel?'
021 The thick part transition over to a region of (019/020 out of focus and used 400 hz - deleted)
023 Zoom in on villi - see collagen basal layer

028 Could it be interesting to looko at hwo much collagen is in the top of the villi (027 - at 400hz -deleted)

# ibd-serotonin-21-3

list of images in C:\Users\lilledah\OneDrive - NTNU\Projects\2021 IBD-serotonin\serotonin-21-3\ibd-serotonin-21-3-image-series.txt

Sample 10653-26t on stage. Two samples on slide. Used leftmost as seen from above stage. Stage reference as shown in figure.

TPEF channel saturates. Maybe different scan with different power.
Inital settints power/gain = 50/30. Just a few pixels in saturation
Forward signal is MUCH stronger than backward signal.
Remember to set scan speed = 100, PMT gain = 800.

Rotate 90 degrees to make image correspond to stage view.

Collected at x locations using 3 sequential scans.

DAPI signal is ok for orienting location for next scan, use 200 but remember to switch back to 100
Remeber to refocus imaging layer when shifting position. Fluorescence channel saturated. Maybe not a problem as this channel probably wont be used???

Remember to check if location is stored in metadata
Maybe if detector shut down try do move to nearby locations.
Saturation points that cause shutdown are often seen as small grainy enclusures.

When all settings are applied. Imaging a single sample proably takes less than 30 min.

1024x1024 gives significantly sharper image. The maximum intensity level in the counted channels is reduced.
2048 is even better but starts to takes some time.

Test excitation wavelength relative to filter to reduce autofluorescence

Forgot to open pinhole for DAPI

Seems like the only quick gdd settings made are for 5x dry (which is max) and zero. The other settings have no effect. 

The 63x signal did not seem to give much in terms additional structure. The z-resolution is better but the structure is not much different.

# ibd-serotonin-22-1-1

Collected overview images of rat ileum sections (physical sample serotonin-22-1). Primary intention is for recording location of high resolution LSM images.

Slides where imaged on Zeiss LSM 800. BF and DAPI signals where collected on camera. Stiching was used for larger sections to cover whole area.

The files were named as in the following list. The two first numbers are markings on the slide. The last letter indicates which of several sections on one slide. The letter A was closes to the marking area on the slide. A .czi file as well as a .tif file were stored

Sample order

* 10653 #26

A lot of DAPI fluorescence in SHG channel. Maybe the staining protocol used has been different

Changed to different sample, same DAPI background

Image 002 70/30 settings.
Image 003 70/22 Power set to avoid any saturation
Image 004 70/30 Dapi is completly saturated.
