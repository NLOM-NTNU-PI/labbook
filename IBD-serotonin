# IBD-serotnoin/21/1

The goal of this experiment is a preliminary exploration of the samples as a basis for design of future studies. In particular to test if the samples yield an interesting an measureable SHG signal.
 
##Samples
Samples are mounted glass slides provided by Atle van Belen Granlund from the IBD group at St. Olavs hospital.
Samples are mouse intenstine (MI)

A mounted cartilage (unknown source) sample labled xxx is used as a test sample for testing that SHG imaging is working properly

##Experiment

(RLD2/TLD2 is shorter wavelength, ie SHG)

Using Leica SP8 standard MP configuration. Error message 51 from cameleon laser during init.

Test image of cartilage gave good signal

In BF of MI three layers could be seen. An inner layer with radial directionality, a middle layer with circumferential directionality, an outer layer with radial directionality. Relativ thickness about 1/1/3.

Image 10653-26t
Middle layer seems to give a good SHG signal both forward and backwards. The thickness of the layer seems to vary in thickness. First images were off focus. In focus a top layer with stronger fluorescene appears and holes (canals) in the lower layer appears. THere seems to be some SHG signal (collagen fibrils?) on the innermost surface.

At zoom 1, 100Hz, power 23/42 no sign of damage.

Can see vessels in the collagen rich layer.

There is some collagen in the outer surface, that also extends down in the first layer. The signal in the inner layer is weak. Saturation of some necessary to see.

At another location, no SHG can be seen in the inner surface. But the surface looks a little different, maybe a sectioning artifact.

Seems like no DAPI signal (tried at 780 excitation).

The samples are quite thin, no z-stack possible. But the optimal imaging plane zeems quite flat. OK for tilescabn

Difficult with tile scan as the fluorescence hyd overloads and goes blank.

Setting up til xcan worked well

Tried to change flourescence to internal signal bu very little signal there. But fully opening pin hole again gave a good signal.

Change sample to 10054-
