# IBD-serotnoin/21/1

The goal of this experiment is a preliminary exploration of the samples as a basis for design of future studies. In particular to test if the samples yield an interesting an measureable SHG signal.
 
##Samples

##Experiment

(RLD2/TLD2 is shorter wavelength, ie SHG)

Using Leica SP8 standard MP configuration. Error message 51 from cameleon laser during init.

Test image of cartilage gave good signal

In BF of MI three layers could be seen. An inner layer with radial directionality, a middle layer with circumferential directionality, an outer layer with radial directionality. Relativ thickness about 1/1/3.

Image 10653-26t
Middle layer seems to give a good SHG signal both forward and backwards. The thickness of the layer seems to vary in thickness. First images were off focus. In focus a top layer with stronger fluorescene appears and holes (canals) in the lower layer appears. THere seems to be some SHG signal (collagen fibrils?) on the innermost surface.

At zoom 1, 100Hz, power 23/42 no sign of damage.

Can see vessels in the collagen rich layer.

There is some collagen in the outer surface, that also extends down in the first layer. The signal in the inner layer is weak. Saturation of some necessary to see.

At another location, no SHG can be seen in the inner surface. But the surface looks a little different, maybe a sectioning artifact.

Seems like no DAPI signal (tried at 780 excitation).

The samples are quite thin, no z-stack possible. But the optimal imaging plane zeems quite flat. OK for tilescabn

Difficult with tile scan as the fluorescence hyd overloads and goes blank.

Setting up til xcan worked well

Tried to change flourescence to internal signal bu very little signal there. But fully opening pin hole again gave a good signal.

Change sample to 10054-

#serotonin-21-2

##Notes
Checked SHG signal on cartilage test sample - good signal. Also good fluorescence in internal PMT.

Sample 10653-23t

Base filename serotonin-21-2
001-DAPI - image of epithelial cells with phalloidin and dapi. 760 nm excitation
001 Image of DAPI. Good signal laser: 30/25, gain pmt 750, bw 395-450
002 Same location - multichannel
004 New location
005 Zoom = 2 Some SHG extending into the lamina propria
006 zoom 2, outside the mucosa muscularis, 
007 Zoom 4 (according to system z stack is 15 mu - not much resolution to hope for - try 63 x)
009 Different location
010 Differen location
011 Zoom just abov mucosa muscularis

10654-27t
012 Seems to be some change in the submucosa? Much broader and less dens in some regions, 
013 same, different location
014 Transition between 'normal/thin' region and thicker
On preivous 3 images forgot to put on 50 Hz
015 'Normal region'
016 Transition region again at 50 hz
017 Thick region again at 50 hz
018 'kjertel?'
021 The thick part transition over to a region of (019/020 out of focus and used 400 hz - deleted)
023 Zoom in on villi - see collagen basal layer
024 Differen location - normal

028 Could it be interesting to looko at hwo much collagen is in the top of the villi (027 - at 400hz -deleted)
029 Testing out 20248x2048 an - HYD shutdown
