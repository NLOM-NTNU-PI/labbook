Training for cell-lab. Learned to split cells.

MC3T3 cells were thawed yesterday (which ones) and seeded in 25 cm2 (T25) flasks.

Splitting procedure
* Remove medium. Wash with PBS
* Add 1 ml trypsin, incubate. Cells were loose after about 5 min (checked on microscope).
* Add 4 ml medium. Resuspend.
* 4.5 ml into new T75 flask with 8 ml medium. Placed in incubator.
* 0.5 ml used for counting cells. Three counts: 6.9e5, 6.0e5, 5.6e5 cells/ml. Divide by 2 to get concentration: 3.1e5 cells/ml. Had 5 ml in small container: 1.6e6 cells. 4.5 ml in new T75 flask: 1.4e6 cells.
