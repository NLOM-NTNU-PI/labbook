Training for splitting cells on my own.

Cells counted in cellcounter, 2 readings in each field
| A     | B     |
|---    |---    |
| 4e5   | 3.1e5 |
| 3.6e5 | 3.6e5 |

Average concentration (x2) = 7.2e5 cells/ml.  Total 7.2e6 cells in flask.

12 ml medium in new T75 flask with 1 ml cell suspenion, 7.2e5 cells.
4 ml medium in new T25 flask with 0.11 ml cell suspension, 0,79e6 cells.
This is passage 29.

Training for cell-lab. Learned to split cells.

MC3T3 cells were thawed yesterday (cells frozen 28.10.21 - P27) and seeded in 25 cm2 (T25) flasks.

Splitting procedure
* Remove medium. Wash with PBS
* Add 1 ml trypsin, incubate. Cells were loose after about 5 min (checked on microscope).
* Add 4 ml medium. Resuspend.
* 4.5 ml into new T75 flask with 8 ml medium. Placed in incubator.
* 0.5 ml used for counting cells. Three counts: 6.9e5, 6.0e5, 5.6e5 cells/ml. Divide by 2 to get concentration: 3.1e5 cells/ml. Had 5 ml in small container: 1.6e6 cells. 4.5 ml in new T75 flask: 1.4e6 cells.
