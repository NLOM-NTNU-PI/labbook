Concentration of cells in Main cell flask appeared quite low. Decided to not split. Exchanged 6 ml medium and returned to incubator.

Exchanged medium in 8-well plate. 300 uL.

Split cells in reserve flask (appeared quite dense in some areas in flask).

Cell counter reading.
| A   | B     |
|---  |---    |
|1.3e5|2.3e5  |
|1.1e5|1.5e5  |
|9.0e4|1.0e5  |

Average concentration (after x2) 2.7e5 cells/ml

6 ml medium added to T25 flask. Added 2 ml of cell suspension (3.4e5 cell)

This was passage 30 in reserve flask. Used medium in 50 ml marked *extra* to use this only for reserve flask and the other for the main flask.

Split cells and seed into 8-well plates for imaging.
Cells were split according to standard protocol.
Seeded into T75 flask marked P30 (passage 30)

Cell counter readings from source flask was
| A      | B     |
|---     |---    |
| 1.7e5  | 1.1e5 |
| 2.0+e5 | 1.2e5 |

(multiply by 2 for assumed tryptophan dilution)

Average concentration 3.0e5 cells/ml

12 ml medium was added to new flask, 1 ml (3.0e5 cells) was added.

2 50 ml bottles with medium were made

300 uL of cell suspension was added to 4 wells in 8-well plate and placed in incubator in weight room.

Training for splitting cells on my own.

Cells counted in cellcounter, 2 readings in each field
| A     | B     |
|---    |---    |
| 4e5   | 3.1e5 |
| 3.6e5 | 3.6e5 |

Average concentration (x2) = 7.2e5 cells/ml.  Total 7.2e6 cells in flask.

12 ml medium in new T75 flask with 1 ml cell suspenion, 7.2e5 cells.
4 ml medium in new T25 flask with 0.11 ml cell suspension, 0,79e6 cells.
This is passage 29.

Training for cell-lab. Learned to split cells.

MC3T3 cells were thawed yesterday (cells frozen 28.10.21 - P27) and seeded in 25 cm2 (T25) flasks.

Splitting procedure
* Remove medium. Wash with PBS
* Add 1 ml trypsin, incubate. Cells were loose after about 5 min (checked on microscope).
* Add 4 ml medium. Resuspend.
* 4.5 ml into new T75 flask with 8 ml medium. Placed in incubator.
* 0.5 ml used for counting cells. Three counts: 6.9e5, 6.0e5, 5.6e5 cells/ml. Divide by 2 to get concentration: 3.1e5 cells/ml. Had 5 ml in small container: 1.6e6 cells. 4.5 ml in new T75 flask: 1.4e6 cells.
