Medium in T75 flask was turbid with thin sheets (biofilm) floating in the media. No healthy cells could be seen. No obvious signs of infection. Uncertain if there has been an infection or if the cells have died (grown too long) and detached.

T25 flask looked good with healthy nearly confluent cells.

Cell count
| A   | B     |
|---  |---    |
|3.7e5|4.2e5  |
|5.4e5|3.6e5  |

Average concentration (x2) 8.5e5 cells/ml

Seeded cells in two new flasks T25 and T75.
T25 flask (T25, 060922, P32)  was seeded with 6 ml medium and 300 uL cell suspension -> 2,5e5 cells.
T75 flask (T75, 060922, P32)  was seeded with 13 ml medium and 1 ml cell suspension -> 8.5e5 cells.

Had to use both 50 ml bottles of medium and these were now empty.

# 310822
Split cells in reserve flask T25, 220822, P30 -> T25, 310822, P31

Cells appeared quite confluent in microscope

Cell count
| A   | B     |
|---  |---    |
|7.1e5|5.1e5  |
|6.3e5|5.6e5  |

Average concentration (x2) 1.2e6 cells/ml

4 ml medium added to new flask. 700 uL of cell suspension, 0,84e6 cells added to new flask.

# 300822
Split cells in main flask, T75, 180822, P30 - > T75, 310822, P31, (marked wrong date on flask)

Cell counter reading.
| A   | B     |
|---  |---    |
|4.8e5|5.1e5  |
|4.7e5|6.0e5  |

Average concentration (x2): 1.0e6 cells/ml

Seeded 2 ml cell suspension, 2.0e6 cells into new T75 flask with 12 ml medium (-AA)

Exchanged medium in 8 well plate (300 uL)

# 290822

Both flasks appeared quite full with cells, as determined from microscopy.

# 260822

Checked both flasks. There appeared to be very few cells in both, by visual inspection in the microscope. 

From thermofischer (https://www.thermofisher.com/no/en/home/references/gibco-cell-culture-basics/cell-culture-protocols/cell-culture-useful-numbers.html) the following guidelines are given

| flask | seeding | confluence  |
|---    |---      |---          |
|T75   | 2.1e6   | 8.4e6        |
|T25  | 0.7e6   | 2.8e6   |

T25 flask was seeded with 3.4e5 cells (220822) which is about half of guidelines.

T75 flask was seeded with 3.0e5 cells (180822) which is almost 1/10 of recommendation so no wonder it takes some time.

# 220822
Concentration of cells in Main cell flask appeared quite low. Decided to not split. Exchanged 6 ml medium and returned to incubator.

Exchanged medium in 8-well plate. 300 uL.

Split cells in reserve flask (appeared quite dense in some areas in flask).

Cell counter reading.
| A   | B     |
|---  |---    |
|1.3e5|2.3e5  |
|1.1e5|1.5e5  |
|9.0e4|1.0e5  |

Average concentration (after x2) 2.7e5 cells/ml

6 ml medium added to T25 flask. Added 2 ml of cell suspension (3.4e5 cell)

This was passage 30 in reserve flask. Used medium in 50 ml marked *extra* to use this only for reserve flask and the other for the main flask.

# 180822
Split cells and seed into 8-well plates for imaging.
Cells were split according to standard protocol.
Seeded into T75 flask marked P30 (passage 30)

Cell counter readings from source flask was
| A      | B     |
|---     |---    |
| 1.7e5  | 1.1e5 |
| 2.0+e5 | 1.2e5 |

(multiply by 2 for assumed tryptophan dilution)

Average concentration 3.0e5 cells/ml

12 ml medium was added to new flask, 1 ml (3.0e5 cells) was added.

2 50 ml bottles with medium were made

300 uL of cell suspension was added to 4 wells in 8-well plate and placed in incubator in weight room.

# 150822
Training for splitting cells on my own.

Cells counted in cellcounter, 2 readings in each field
| A     | B     |
|---    |---    |
| 4e5   | 3.1e5 |
| 3.6e5 | 3.6e5 |

Average concentration (x2) = 7.2e5 cells/ml.  Total 7.2e6 cells in flask.

12 ml medium in new T75 flask with 1 ml cell suspenion, 7.2e5 cells.
4 ml medium in new T25 flask with 0.11 ml cell suspension, 0,79e6 cells.
This is passage 29.

# 120822

Training for cell-lab. Learned to split cells.

MC3T3 cells were thawed yesterday (cells frozen 28.10.21 - P27) and seeded in 25 cm2 (T25) flasks.

Splitting procedure
* Remove medium. Wash with PBS
* Add 1 ml trypsin, incubate. Cells were loose after about 5 min (checked on microscope).
* Add 4 ml medium. Resuspend.
* 4.5 ml into new T75 flask with 8 ml medium. Placed in incubator.
* 0.5 ml used for counting cells. Three counts: 6.9e5, 6.0e5, 5.6e5 cells/ml. Divide by 2 to get concentration: 3.1e5 cells/ml. Had 5 ml in small container: 1.6e6 cells. 4.5 ml in new T75 flask: 1.4e6 cells.
