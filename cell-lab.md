## Splitting cells
Cells in T25 flask looked nice

Cell count

| A   | B     |
|---  |---    |
|3.9e5|2.7e5  |
|3.0e5|3.1e5  |

Average cell count (/2) was 1.59e5 c/ml.

Seeded 1.9 ml in new T25 flask for 3e5 cells. I think the flask was erronously marked 140423 instead of 130423.

Passage 29

## Well plates.

The cells in previous well plate 100423 did not seem to have attached. They looked round and floating. Uncertain what happened. Returned the cells to incubator in weighing room

Added cells to a new well plate (0.31 ml for 5e4 cells per well). Added an additional 1 ml of medium.

# 100423

Cells in flask seeded with 3e5 looked highly confluent, some cells looked more square than spindle like, maybe indicating that cells had started to bind together or form some matrix. After trypsin, the cells also seemed to stay attached to eachother. The flask with 1e5 c did not seem very confluent. Exchanged 4 ml cell medium from this flask and returned to cell (this as a backup if the split cells from the other flasks behave as desired).

Seeded 3.1 ml in new T75 flask for 5e5 cells, and 0.63 ml in new T25 flask for 1e5 cells.
Flasks marked P39 (which is now correct)

Old T25 returned to incubator

# 051022

Cells in both T25 and T75 flasks seemed quite sparse. Decided not to split. As noticed last time, should probably seed with slightly higher density for a 3-4 splitting frequency. Discarded the T25 flask from 230922. The cells appeared quite confluent there.

# 300922

Split cells in main, T75, flask. 

Cell density appeared quite low in the main flask and the T25 flask from 270922/P37 (subjective 40%). In the T25 flask from 230922/P36 the cells appeared confluent but had not detached (this flask was discarded).

Cell count from T75/270922/P37

| A   | B     |
|---  |---    |
|1.1e5|1.3e5  |
|2.0e5|1.9e5  |

Average count (/2) 0.8 cells/ml.

Seeded 2.5 ml cell suspension in T75 flask for 2.0e5 cells

Seeded 0.6 ml cell suspension in T25 flask for 0.5e5 cells.

**Notice that both this flask should be P38 but I think both might be marked with the wrong passage number.**

The T25 flask from 270922/P37 was kept in the incubator

Have been aiming for 2.0e5/0.5e5 cells in T75/T25 flask for 4 days incubation and tried 3.0e5/0.5e5 cells for 3 days of incubation. The cell counts/confluence are a little too low. Change to 5e5/1e5 cells when seeding to see if the cell counts after 3-4 days are a little higher.

# 270922

The cells in the T75 flask were seemed nearly confluent but not quite there (subjective 80%). The T25 appeared somewhat less confluent (subjective 60%). The T25 was kept in incubator as additional reserve.

Split cells from T75 flask.

Decided to seed out somewhat more cells in new T75 flask since three days till next splitting. Seeded 2.7 ml for 3.0 e5 cells in new flask. Used 11 ml medium. P37 (though I think maybe the flask was marked erronously with P36).

Seeded 0.45 ml in new T25 reserve flask for 0.5e5 cells. Used 5.5 ml medium. P37.

Seeded
# 260922

Checked cells in microscope. Looked good, quite a bit of cells but not confluent. Seemed slightly less dense in T25 flask.

# 140922

Cellmedium in T75 flask appeared clear. In the microscope the cells appear highly confluent with a high contrast network around them. When adding trypsin the cells detached in sheets, and appear similar to T75 flask on 060922. Current hyptothesis is that the cells have started to produce matrix and are stuck in the matrix. Contents were discarded.

T25 flask appear normal, confluent but low contrast. Added 1 ml of trypsin (instead of .5 ml). Cells detached noramlly.

# 060922
Medium in T75 flask was turbid with thin sheets (biofilm) floating in the media. No healthy cells could be seen. No obvious signs of infection. Uncertain if there has been an infection or if the cells have died (grown too long) and detached.

T25 flask looked good with healthy nearly confluent cells.

Seeded cells in two new flasks T25 and T75.
T25 flask (T25, 060922, P32)  was seeded with 6 ml medium and 300 uL cell suspension -> 2,5e5 cells.
T75 flask (T75, 060922, P32)  was seeded with 13 ml medium and 1 ml cell suspension -> 8.5e5 cells.

Had to use both 50 ml bottles of medium and these were now empty.

Exchanged medium in 8 well plate (300 uL)

# 290822

Both flasks appeared quite full with cells, as determined from microscopy.

# 260822

Checked both flasks. There appeared to be very few cells in both, by visual inspection in the microscope. 

From thermofischer (https://www.thermofisher.com/no/en/home/references/gibco-cell-culture-basics/cell-culture-protocols/cell-culture-useful-numbers.html) the following guidelines are given

| flask | seeding | confluence  |
|---    |---      |---          |
|T75   | 2.1e6   | 8.4e6        |
|T25  | 0.7e6   | 2.8e6   |

T25 flask was seeded with 3.4e5 cells (220822) which is about half of guidelines.

T75 flask was seeded with 3.0e5 cells (180822) which is almost 1/10 of recommendation so no wonder it takes some time.

# 220822
Concentration of cells in Main cell flask appeared quite low. Decided to not split. Exchanged 6 ml medium and returned to incubator.

Exchanged medium in 8-well plate. 300 uL.

12 ml medium was added to new flask, 1 ml (3.0e5 cells) was added.

2 50 ml bottles with medium were made

# 120822

Training for cell-lab. Learned to split cells.

MC3T3 cells were thawed yesterday (cells frozen 28.10.21 - P27) and seeded in 25 cm2 (T25) flasks.

Splitting procedure
* Remove medium. Wash with PBS
* Add 1 ml trypsin, incubate. Cells were loose after about 5 min (checked on microscope).
* Add 4 ml medium. Resuspend.
* 4.5 ml into new T75 flask with 8 ml medium. Placed in incubator.
* 0.5 ml used for counting cells. Three counts: 6.9e5, 6.0e5, 5.6e5 cells/ml. Divide by 2 to get concentration: 3.1e5 cells/ml. Had 5 ml in small container: 1.6e6 cells. 4.5 ml in new T75 flask: 1.4e6 cells.
